# This application requires Docker to be installed

Install from <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/> and follow the instructions for your system
Once you do, proceed

## Building the app

### Install & Run

- Create a folder in the project root called "database", so that any data you enter, persists when you shut down the containers.

- Make a .env file in the project root with these three values:
`export SECRET_KEY=""
export ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
export ALGORITHM="HS256"`
Secret Key is generated by running the command `openssl rand -hex 32` in your terminal. The key generated, is your Secret Key

- When you're ready, start your application by navigating into the root of this project and run in terminal:
`docker compose up --build -d`
This runs docker compose command in detached mode, so the terminal is not occupied.

This will pull the necessary images, both the python and the dynamo db instance, into docker and run the containers.
Check Docker either via desktop or command, for 2 running containers, named "api" and "dynamodb", representing the api and dynamo db respectively.

Once the containers are runnning, you can navigate to the api documentation by going to <http://localhost:8080/docs> and the FastApi interface should appear, listing all the api methods that are currently accesible
